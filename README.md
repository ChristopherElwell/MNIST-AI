My implementation of backpropogation, gradient descent, and various other AI infrastructure components to develop a digit-reading AI. Trained on the MNIST data set for roughly 20 minutes, achieving a 94% accuracy on digit classification. Requires only eigen to compile.

The ai_tester.py script allows the user to draw their own digits, providing live user-based classification as a demonstration of the AI's capabilities. ai_tester.py uses tkinter, customtkinter, and numpy. Requires a neural.csv file, which is provided, but can also be created with the ai.cpp script after training.
